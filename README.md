# love-question
A playful interactive web page that asks “Do you love me?” with colorful, protest-style letters. The “No” button playfully dodges the cursor, making it hard to click, while the “Yes” button reveals a fun love message. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fully responsive and visually engaging.
